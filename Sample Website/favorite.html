        <h1>My Favorite Thing to Do</h1>
        <p>In my free time, I love to follow sports. I will willingly watch any Boston team... except the Revolution. I watch almost all Celtics and Patriots games. While I'm not so great at playing any sport, I find reading trade rumors, mock drafts, and analysis very interesting. I'm always willing to talk about either team, so feel free to talk sports to me at any time.</p>

        <p>This is Kyrie Irving. He is #11 on the Boston Celtics. A year after winning a championship with Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, he requested a trade out of CLE. Later that summer he was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for my favorite player at the time, Isaiah Thomas, and other stuff. Now he is looking to bring championship No.18 to Boston.</p>

        <p>Pictured above is Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr., known popularly as Tom Brady or the G.O.A.T. After being drafted 199th overall in the 1999 NFL Draft, Brady filled in for Drew Bledsoe at quarterback for the New England Patriots. He has held that position since, and has won 5 Super Bowls. He is truly the greatest football player to every live.</p>
